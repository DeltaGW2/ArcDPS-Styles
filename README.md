# ArcDPS-Styles
A public repository for users to post their custom arc styles, colours & icons.

When using `arcdps.ini` files from this repository, keep in mind that it will contain a number of different settings, if you just want to copy the style, extract the relevant ones from the file and replace them in your own config.
The relevant keys in the config file are the following:
```
appearance_imgui_style=
appearance_imgui_colours=
appearance_arc_colours=
appearance_arc_chcli_colours=
appearance_arc_buffs_colours=
appearance_arc_lists_colours=
appearance_proft_colours=
appearance_profb_colours=
appearance_sqt_colours=
appearance_sqb_colours=
appearance_imgui_style180=
appearance_imgui_colours180=
```


When adding to this project, please use a neutral background for screenshots. Add a folder with your style number, to include custom resources like icons or the `arcdps.ini` file.
